## Introduction
The Data Science in Production course is an online course that teaches how to design and implement a data science, machine learning project with Python, from the dataset until the model deployment. The course covers also the creation of a Telegram bot, as well as the creation of a Cloud-based API and Story-Telling techniques.

Unlike other online courses, this one is particularly special because it has a business-driven approach to solve a real business problem, so that the student can really think and understand the underlying logic behind the problem request, hence one can develop a sophisticated solution that meets the business-team expectation and bring value to it.

For more details, please visit the [Data Science in Production website.](https://sejaumdatascientist.com/como-ser-um-data-scientist/)

The detailed description, step-by-step solution is described below.

## Module 01. The Business Problem
### 1. The Problem: the business team requested a 6-weeks sales forecast.

**Key points to understand a data science problem:**
- What is the motivation? What is the context behind?
- What is the root cause? Why does the business team need a forecast?
- Who is the Stakeholder?
- What is the expected solution format?

In this case, the key point of the problem are:
- **Request:** the CFO requested this solution to the business team in a management meeting;
- **The root cause:** the CFO aims to reform the stores. However, it is extremely hard to determine the reform budget for each store;
- **The Stakeholder:** The CFO is the Stakeholder;
- **Solution Format:**
    - **Granularity:** Daily sales forecast (in R$) per store for the next 6 weeks;
    - **Problem Type:** Sales forecast;
    - **Potential Methods:** Time Series, Regression, Neural Networks;
    - **Output Shape:** Sales forecast displayed in a smartphone.

The above-mentioned key points show that there is relevant content behind the 6 weeks sales forecast request: the final goal is to reform the stores. However, it is not possible to set a budget for that without knowing the revenue for the period: it is a risk, for example, if the reform budget exceeds the total amount of sales, that is, pratical there would not be enough money to finish the reform.

### 2. The Data
The Dataset applied to develop the solution is the [Rossmann Store Sales from Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data)

### 3. Solution approach: The CRISP-DS Cycle
To design, model and deploy the solution will be applied the CRISP-DS (Cross-Industry Standard Process - Data Science, a.k.a. CRISP-DM) project management method.
The CRISP is a cyclic, iterative development method that covers all the steps needed to solve a data science problem. The image below shows the CRISP cycle:
